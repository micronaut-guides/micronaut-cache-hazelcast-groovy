In this guide you are going to integrate a Micronaut application with https://hazelcast.org/[Hazelcast]. Hazelcast is an open
source in-memory data grid based on Java. Hazelcast provides central, predictable scaling of applications through in-memory access
to frequently used data and across an elastically scalable data grid. Micronaut is easily integratable with Hazelcast as a cache
mechanism.

Micronaut will be a client to the Hazelcast node cluster.
