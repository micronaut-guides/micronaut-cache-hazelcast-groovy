Let's create a service which has some methods that need to be cached. The service will simply count how many time the methods are invoked
and it will return a message. When Hazelcast places a new value in the cache, the counter will be incremented.
When Hazelcast references a previously cached value the method is not invoked and the value is retrieved from the cache on the Hazelcast cluster.

It is important to note that the key will be the method parameter, and the return value the value in the cache.

<1> Cache the return value
<2> Invalidate all members of the cache before placing the new value
<3> Always execute this method and update the cache with the return value. Generally use this annotation when stale data
is to be updated, without blowing away the whole cache.
