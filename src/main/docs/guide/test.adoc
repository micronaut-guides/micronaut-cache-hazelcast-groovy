We can verify that the cache works as expected with spock tests.

For the test, we will create an embedded Hazelcast server at the beginning in the `setupSpec()` method. This create an instance
on the default port `5701`. Note in production it is more likely that a Hazelcast node cluster will be mounted on a separate server resource.
In the `cleanupSpec()`, the instance is shutdown.

The test will execute by passing an initial value into the `returnMessage(String message)` method. The method will execute and initialize the cache.
When called a second time, the counter is not increased because the cached values are retrieved.

The comments in the test below describe the intent and expectations.

<1> Embedded Hazelcast node cluster.
<2> Shutdown the Hazelcast node cluster.

For further testing of `@CachePut` and `@CacheInvalidate`, please see the `MessageServiceSpec` in the /complete project.

NOTE: To test the application use the `./gradlew test` command.
