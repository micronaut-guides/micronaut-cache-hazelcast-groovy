Let's configure the application to be a client to a Hazelcast cache server. Go to the file below and add dependencies.

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=build]
----

Simple add configuration below to name the cache, as well as provide the addresses. This is the minimal configuration
needed to get started.

[source, yml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=config]
----

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, a Micronaut application can be created with the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#quickStart[CLI] using the `--feature hazelcast` flag. Create the application with the command
below. This will create a Micronaut application with the `build.gradle` and `application.yml` configured for Hazelcast.

- `mn create-app testapp --lang groovy --features hazelcast`
